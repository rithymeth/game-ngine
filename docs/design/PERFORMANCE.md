# Performance record

Numbers from CI, not from a developer machine. Each table says where it came from, so the next one can be compared with it.

## Benchmarks: Linux GCC, RelWithDebInfo, GitHub-hosted runner

Source: the `Linux (GCC)` job of the run for PR #212 (commit `88e4bdf`, 2026-10-13), `aether_bench --repeat 5`. The
runner's calibration loop took 1.722 ms; `norm` is the median divided by it, which is what the baseline comparison
uses so a slow or noisy runner does not fail the gate.

## What the numbers say

- **Frame budget.** 1000 navigation agents cost about 2 ms per frame (59.6 ms for 30; the best run was 37 ms, about
  1.2 ms). Iterating 100k entities takes 0.1 ms.
- **Loading.** A 10k-entity binary scene loads in 35.6 ms (about 3.6 microseconds an entity); the JSON form is 1.6x
  slower. A streaming cell of 400 entities decodes in roughly 1.5 ms, so the 35 ms seen in a Debug build earlier was
  about 25 times inflated by the missing optimiser. The hitch budget (42.7) should be judged on the optimised number.
- **Hierarchical path finding** is 2.7x slower than plain Detour on the open 100-tile floor in an optimised build
  (0.57 ms against 0.21 ms for 20 queries), not the 8x seen in Debug. It is still not a win on this mesh.
- **Texture cooking** is the slowest thing measured (BC7 256x256 takes 226 ms), which matters for import times.

## A regression the baseline reports

The same run reports `bp/loop_arith_10k` at 3.61x its checked-in baseline (limit 3.00x). The step is advisory
(`continue-on-error`), so CI stays green. It is either a real slowdown of the Blueprint VM or a baseline taken on a
different machine; it should be bisected before the baseline is regenerated and the step made required.
